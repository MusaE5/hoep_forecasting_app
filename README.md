# HOEP Forecasting App ‚ö°

A real-time electricity price forecasting application for Ontario's Hourly Ontario Energy Price (HOEP) using machine learning and live data integration.

---

## üìö Research Background

This application is an offshoot of my ongoing electricity market research, prioritizing **uncertainty quantification over speed** using feed-forward neural networks with quantile predictions. Rather than pursuing millisecond inference times, this system focuses on providing robust confidence intervals for price forecasts, which is crucial for risk management in electricity markets.

The research-to-production pipeline demonstrates end-to-end deployment of machine learning research, taking academic concepts through to live, automated forecasting systems with real market data.
